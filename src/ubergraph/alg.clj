(defn shortest-path 
  "Finds the shortest path in graph g. You must specify a start node or a collection
of start nodes from which to begin the search, however specifying an end node
is optional. If an end node condition is specified, this function will return an 
implementation of the IPath protocol, representing the shortest path. Otherwise, 
it will search out as far as it can go, and return an implementation of the 
IAllPathsFromSource protocol, which contains all the data needed to quickly find
the shortest path to a given destination (using IAllPathsFromSource's `path-to` 
protocol function).

If :traverse is set to true, then the function will instead return a lazy sequence
of the shortest paths from the start node(s) to each node in the graph in the order
the nodes are encountered by the search process.

Takes a search-specification map which must contain:
Either :start-node (single node) or :start-nodes (collection)

Map may contain the following entries:
Either :end-node (single node) or :end-nodes (collection) or :end-node? (predicate function) 
:cost-fn - A function that takes an edge as an input and returns a cost 
          (defaults to every edge having a cost of 1, i.e., breadth-first search if no cost-fn given)
:cost-attr - Alternatively, can specify an edge attribute to use as the cost
:heuristic-fn - A function that takes a node as an input and returns a
          lower-bound on the distance to a goal node, used to guide the search
          and make it more efficient.
:node-filter - A predicate function that takes a node and returns true or false.
          If specified, only nodes that pass this node-filter test will be considered in the search.
:edge-filter - A predicate function that takes an edge and returns true or false.
          If specified, only edges that pass this edge-filter test will be considered in the search.

Map may contain the following additional entries if a traversal sequence is desired:
:traverse true - Changes output to be a sequence of paths in order encountered.
:min-cost - Filters traversal sequence, only applies if :traverse is set to true
:max-cost - Filters traversal sequence, only applies if :traverse is set to true

  "Given an ubergraph g, and one or more start nodes,
the Bellman-Ford algorithm produces an implementation of the
IAllPathsFromSource protocol if no negative-weight cycle that is 
reachable from the source exits, and false otherwise, indicating 
that no solution exists.

bellman-ford is very similar to shortest-path.  It is less efficient,
but it correctly handles graphs with negative edges.  If you know you
have edges with negative costs, use bellman-ford.  If you are unsure
whether your graph has negative costs, or don't understand when and
why you'd want to use bellman-ford, just use shortest-path and it
will make the decision for you, calling this function if necessary. 

Takes a search-specification map which must contain:
Either :start-node (single node) or :start-nodes (collection)

Map may contain the following entries:
Either :end-node (single node) or :end-nodes (collection) or :end-node? (predicate function) 
:cost-fn - A function that takes an edge as an input and returns a cost 
          (defaults to weight, or 1 if no weight is present)
:cost-attr - Alternatively, can specify an edge attribute to use as the cost
:node-filter - A predicate function that takes a node and returns true or false.
          If specified, only nodes that pass this node-filter test will be considered in the search.
:edge-filter - A predicate function that takes an edge and returns true or false.
          If specified, only edges that pass this edge-filter test will be considered in the search.

Map may contain the following additional entries if a traversal sequence is desired:
:traverse true - Changes output to be a sequence of paths in order encountered.
:min-cost - Filters traversal sequence, only applies if :traverse is set to true
:max-cost - Filters traversal sequence, only applies if :traverse is set to true
