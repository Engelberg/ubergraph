; NEW CONCEPTS

; There are three new protocols above and beyond what is in Loom:
; UndirectedGraph for undirected graphs
; QueryableGraph for attribute graphs and multigraphs
; MixedDirectionGraph for graphs which support a mixture of directed and undirected edges
;    within the same graph

; For undirected graph algorithms, it is useful to know the connection between the
; two sides of an undirected edge, so we can keep attributes and weight in sync
; and add/remove or otherwise mark them in sync.
(defprotocol UndirectedGraph
  (other-direction [g edge] "Returns the other direction of this edge in graph g"))

; We need a way to retrieve edges that is friendly to both regular and multi-graphs,
; but especially important for multi-graphs.
(defprotocol QueryableGraph
  (find-edges [g src dest] [g query] "Returns all edges that match the query")
  (find-edge [g src dest] [g query] "Returns first edge that matches the query"))

; Sample queries
; (find-edges g {:src 1, :dest 3, :color :red})  
;    finds all edges from 1 to 3 with :color :red in edge attributes
;
; (find-edges g {:src 1, :weight 5})
;    finds all edges from 1 with a weight of 5
;
; (find-edges g {:dest :Chicago, :airline :Delta, :time :afternoon})
;    finds all edges leading to :Chicago with :airline :Delta and 
;    :time :afternoon in edge attributes

; It would be nice to have a way to incorporate both undirected and directed edges
; into the same graph structure.

(defprotocol MixedDirectionEdgeTests
  (undirected-edge? [e] "Is e one 'direction' of an undirected edge?")
  (directed-edge? [e] "Is e a directed edge?")
  (mirror-edge? [e] "Is e the mirrored half of the undirected edge?"))

(defprotocol MixedDirectionGraph
  (add-directed-edges* [g edges] "Adds directed edges regardless of the graph's undirected/directed default")
  (add-undirected-edges* [g edges] "Adds undirected edges regardless of the graph's undirected/directed default"))

; Improved attribute handling

(defprotocol Attrs
  (add-attrs [g node-or-edge attribute-map] [g n1 n2 attribute-map] "Merges an attribute map with the existing attributes of a node or edge")
  (set-attrs [g node-or-edge attribute-map] [g n1 n2 attribute-map] "Sets the attribute map of a node or edge, overwriting existing attribute map")  
  (remove-attrs [g node-or-edge attributes] [g n1 n2 attributes] "Removes the attributes from the node or edge"))

; Path protocols

(defprotocol IPath
  "All the things you can do to a path"
  (edges-in-path [path] "A list of edges comprising the path" )
  (nodes-in-path [path] "A list of nodes comprising the path" )
  (cost-of-path [path] "Returns the cost of the path with respect to the property that was minimized
in the search that produced this path." )
  (start-of-path [path] "Returns the first node in the path")
  (end-of-path [path] "Returns the last node in the path")
  (last-edge-of-path [path] "Returns the last edge in the path"))

(defprotocol IAllPathsFromSource "An object that knows how to produce paths on demand from a given source,
using path-to"
  (path-to [paths dest] "The shortest path to dest"))

(defprotocol IAllPaths "An object that knows how to produce paths on demand between any pair of nodes,
using path-between"
  (path-between [paths src dest] "The shortest path between src and dest" ))

; Recognizing Ubergraphs

(defprotocol IUbergraph "Is it an Ubergraph?"
  (ubergraph? [g]))
